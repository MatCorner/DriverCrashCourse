# Running the app

- First run `npm install`.
- In `public/index.html`, change the proxy to the port number on which your server is running.
- In `src/App.js`, replace the component with the page/component you want to render.
- Make sure the server is running, then run `npm run start`. The webpage should pop up automatically in your default browser.
